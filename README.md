Here are the short notes for each experiment, focusing on the steps to follow:

Experiment 8: Browser Security

Aim: Study steps to ensure web browser security (using Mozilla Firefox).    

Steps:

Open Mozilla Firefox and go to "Options" from the hamburger menu.    

In the "General" tab, under "Downloads", select "Always ask me where to save files".    

Go to the "Privacy" tab.

Ensure all four checkboxes in the "General" section are checked.    

In the "Logins" section, you can set up a "Master Password" and it's recommended not to let the browser remember passwords.    

Experiment 9: Digital Signature

Aim: Implement a program to generate a digital signature.    

Steps:

Enter the text to be encrypted in the ‘Plaintext’ area and generate the hash value by clicking the SHA-1 button.    

Copy the content of the Hash Output (hex) field and paste it into the Input to RSA (hex) field.    

Select the keysize of the public key from the RSA Public key section.    

Click the "Apply RSA" button to generate a digital signature.    

Experiment 10: Wireless Network Components and Mobile Security Apps

Aim: Study wireless network components and features of a Mobile Security App.    

Steps:

Wireless Network Components:

Identify the components of a wireless network: wireless network adapters, wireless routers, wireless antennas, wireless repeaters.    
Understand the difference between infrastructure and ad hoc networks.    
Mobile Security App:

Identify and study a mobile security app (CM Security).
